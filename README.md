# web-scraping

My first web scraping try. I wanted to get the birth date of some known lgbtqiap+ ppl to create a list to feed something (🤷) to get them remembered in their birthday. Still working on the idea.

Im using Selenium to search the names from the json file and get the birth date. Then i export the list with names and birth date in a xlsx file.
